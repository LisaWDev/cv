            <td><strong> Designer at Investec Asset Management & Ninety One, London.</strong><br>
            Investec had a structured fine toothcombed brand which had been around for donkeys years. I stepped in and used the existing templates to create designs for things like event stands, brochures, white papers and fact sheets. This company was soon to demerge from the bank and become Ninety One. In that process my agency work gave me the knowledge I needed to help use the new brand in secret to keep the rebrand as a big surprise for staff. While continueing to work for Investec, I'd slip my black out sheet onto my screen and design the new gifts, white papers and other documents needed, while also feeding back to an external agency who was recreating a tonne of papers in the new brand in time for the launch. I worked with the team to write the guidelines in practice for external agencies or contractors to create files for us when we were over run. The new brand has been around for a few years now and our team continues to work with the lovely bright brand to make it the best it can be.

            <td><strong>Studio Manager at Kindred Agency, London.</strong><br>
            At Kindred, I started as a Graphic Designer/Creative Artworker, using InDesign, Illustrator and Photoshop. Over time, I learnt how to use After Effects and Premiere Pro for animation and video editing and also picked up the photography equipment. This resulted in our Creative Services Studio being divided in two so that I could build a Content Studio for taking photographs. I was extremely busy under a new job of Content Studio Manager. Depending on what clients needed, I found myself being a Designer, Photographer, Video Editor and Animator. Projects ranged from marketing, annual reports and bus side posters to staff photos, stop motion videos and 2D animation for social media. I also frequently spent time teaching and over-seeing Juniors making animations.

            <td><strong>Designer & Studio Workflow Manager at National Theatre, London.</strong><br>
        As both a technical and creative mind, I enjoy both bringing ideas to life and answering design briefs with my own practical solutions. I am happy working on the nitty gritty or the longer more complicated jobs, while always maintaining high attention to detail.

            <td><strong>Graphic Designer & Studio Workflow Manager at National Theatre, London.</strong><br>
                As well as watching as many productions at the NT as possible, I was a brand guardian for the ongoing print and multimedia design needs for 30+ inhouse shows produced annually and all departments of the National Theatre. Alongside being a Graphic Designer, I managed workflow to four print and digital designers. I was also the appointed Lead Designer for all printed materials for the NT’s Education Department and popular productions, such as, War Horse and Dr Seuss’ Cat in the Hat. All design involved managing my own projects, allowing me to liaise internally with employees and externally with printers, keeping control of projects from the beginning until their delivery or installation.</td>
